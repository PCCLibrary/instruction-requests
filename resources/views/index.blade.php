{{--                    <h1>Library Instruction Request</h1>--}}
                    <p>Thank you for your interest in library instruction for your class. Faculty librarians provide information literacy instruction for a large number of classes at PCCâ€™s campuses, centers, and work sites.</p>

                    <p>Librarians can: provide synchronous instruction to face-to-face, online, and hybrid and remote classes; or develop asynchronous instructional tools like videos, tutorials, and research guides tailored to your assignment class.</p>

                    <p>Please fill out the form below <strong>at least one week in advance</strong> of your requested date. The development of some asynchronous online learning objects may require more advanced notice.</p>
