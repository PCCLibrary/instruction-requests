                    <p>Thank you for your interest in library instruction for your class. Faculty librarians provide information literacy instruction for a large number of classes at PCCâ€™s campuses, centers, and work sites.</p>
                    <p>Librarians can: provide synchronous instruction to face-to-face, online, and hybrid and remote classes; or develop asynchronous instructional tools like videos, tutorials, and research guides tailored to your assignment class.</p>
                    <p>Please fill out the form below <strong>at least one week in advance</strong> of your requested date. The development of some asynchronous online learning objects may require more advanced notice.</p>

            <p><strong>Thank you for requesting a library instruction session. A librarian will contact you soon to confirm your reservation.</strong></p>
            <p>Meanwhile, here are a few ways you and your students can get the most from our time together:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
                <li>Please prepare your students in advance of the library session by emphasizing the importance of research skills and letting them know where and when instruction will take place.</li>
                <li>Plan to attend the entire session with your students. Successful library instruction depends upon active, in-class collaboration between the librarian and you as the content expert. We rely on you throughout the session to provide context for your students' needs.</li>
